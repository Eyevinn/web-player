# Eyevinn WebPlayer
The Eyevinn WebPlayer is a simplistic video (audio is on the roadmap) player for playback of ABR streams. It is free-to-use and currently supports the ABR streaming formats Apple HLS, MPEG-DASH.
The player is built using a modular approach which means that a lot of functionality is put into separate modules and can be used independently from each other, we also provide a player module that bundles it all together in a neat package.

### Web Player Web Component

The simplest way to use the Eyevinn WebPlayer is to use the `<eyevinn-video>` web component.

```html
<script async type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/@eyevinn/web-player-component@latest/dist/web-player.component.js"></script>
<eyevinn-video source="https://lab.cdn.eyevinn.technology/VINN-OpbZjryxa3.mp4/manifest.m3u8" starttime="30" muted autoplay></eyevinn-video>
```

### Web Player Javascript

Download the latest release of this package from [jsdelivr](https://registry.npmjs.org/@eyevinn/web-player/-/web-player-0.7.6.tgz) and include the javascript & css files in your HTML.

The snippet below shows an example on how to implement the player

```html
<html>
<head>
  <!-- Eyevinn WebPlayer CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="webplayer.css"></link>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- The element where the player will be placed -->
  <div id="player-wrapper"></div>

  <!-- Eyevinn WebPlayer Javascript -->
  <script src="webplayer.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

  <!-- Initiate the player and auto-play (if allowed by browser) -->
  <script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(event) {
      const player = webplayer(document.querySelector("#player-wrapper"));
      player.load(src).then(function() {
        player.play();
      });
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Web Player Core Component

This is the Core package of the `@eyevinn/web-player`, this package enables playback of HLS and MPEG-DASH on any HTMLMediaElement in any browser. It automagically detects what type of manifest the src is and selects the best underlying open-source or native tech to use. This package can be used without any of the other packages from the `@eyevinn/web-player`.
