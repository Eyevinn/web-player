# Cast

The Cast package provides a `CastSender` class that provides the same state as `@eyevinn/web-player-core` in its STATE_CHANGED event, this allows any developer to make a simple switch between casting & playing locally since the state provided by the cast module is the same as the core module.
It also provides the same API for seeking/play/pause etc.

The developer is expected to use the `<google-cast-launcher />` web component to initialize a cast session.
